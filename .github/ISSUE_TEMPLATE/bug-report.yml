        Before filing a bug, check that you are using the latest version of the
        NDK. The latest stable version and the preview release of the next
        stable version are listed on our wiki:
        https://github.com/android-ndk/ndk/wiki#downloads.


        Make sure your issue isn't on the list of common problems before filing
        a bug:
        https://android.googlesource.com/platform/ndk/+/master/docs/user/common_problems.md

        Describe the bug. Include a test case. It's unlikely that anything can be done without a test case.

        Bug reports with better test cases will be resolved sooner than those with bad test cases. A good test case:

        * Is as small as possible while still exposing the bug.
        * Does not require Android Studio or Gradle. If your bug cannot be reproduced without either of those, it's a bug in Studio or Gradle, and should be reported to Android Studio.
        * Is complete. Snippets that would not compile even in the absence of the bug you are reporting slow down the process.

        Here's an example of a good test case: https://github.com/DanAlbert/dynamic-cast-repro

        Some ways to include test cases:

        * Linking to another git repo with build instructions (preferred)
        * Attaching a zip or tarball to this bug by dragging and dropping into the description text box
        * Linking to a gist
        * Including the full text of the text case here (please use a gist for longer test cases)

        Select all NDK versions in which you have observed this bug. You do not
        need to test all of them, but if you already have that information is
        useful to us! If you're not sure which NDK version you're using, check
        the `android.ndkVersion` for your AGP project, or look in
        `$NDK/source.properties`.


        At least one version must be selected. The currently supported releases
        are listed here. If you observed the bug on a different release, you
        will need to verify that it is still present on a supported release
        before filing.


        If the bug was found in an unreleased build of the NDK, select "canary"
        and include the build information in the description.

        System Maintainer's guide](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/ndk/+/master/docs/BuildSystemMaintainers.md).
