    about: >
      Issues with Android Studio or the Android Gradle Plugin are not handled by
      this team and must be filed against the Android Studio team. Android
      Studio and AGP bugs filed in this bug tracker may be closed without
      investigation.
  - name: Android OS issues, new NDK API requests
    url: https://source.android.com/setup/contribute/report-bugs
    about: >
      Device and OS issues (typically) cannot be fixed in the NDK. Sometimes we
      can add workarounds in the NDK, in which case you can file a feature
      request here, but you should also report the bug against the OS so it can
      be fixed in future versions.
  - name: Questions
    url: https://github.com/android/ndk/discussions
    about: >
      If you have a question about the NDK, ask in the GitHub Discussion forum.
      If your question is "Can you confirm if this is a bug?", go ahead and file
      it as a bug :)

      Note that we generally can't answer questions about Studio or the Android
      Gradle Plugin. For those questions, file a Studio bug using the link
      above.
